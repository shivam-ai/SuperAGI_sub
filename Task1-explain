The provided code implements a simplified version of the GPT-2-small model in PyTorch. It adheres to key GPT-2 design principles, including token and positional embeddings, multi-head self-attention, and feed-forward networks. The GPT2Small class defines the overall architecture, incorporating token embeddings, a positional encoding module (PositionalEncoding), and multiple transformer layers (TransformerLayer). The code allows users to specify vocabulary size, input sequences, and hyperparameters. The implementation is designed for educational purposes and serves as a starting point for more comprehensive GPT-2 models. Users are encouraged to tailor the code to their specific use cases, replacing placeholder values and potentially extending it for training and evaluation purposes.
