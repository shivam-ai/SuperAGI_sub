The provided Python code exemplifies a versatile GPT-2 training script designed to accommodate single GPU, Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), and Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) configurations. It begins by defining a simple GPT-2 model with embedding layers, transformer blocks, and an output layer. Subsequently, a cross-entropy loss function and an Adam optimizer are chosen. For dataset handling, a basic dataset class is introduced and utilized to create a DataLoader. The training loops are then defined, featuring functionality for single GPU, DDP, and FSDP setups, allowing users to choose the appropriate parallelization strategy based on their computing environment. The script is equipped with adjustable parameters such as the number of epochs, device placement, and distributed training specifics. This code serves as a comprehensive starting point for users aiming to train GPT-2 models efficiently across different distributed setups. Users can tailor the model architecture, loss function, optimizer, and data processing according to their specific use cases.
